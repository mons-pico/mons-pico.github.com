Right now the emphasis is on developing support for the Pico encoding, which provides a simple, lightweight encoding for malware files that (1) protects them from harm by anti-malware tools, (2) inactivates them, and (3) allows fast direct access to the raw bytes of the malware.  In short, the desire is to have something better than \"zip.\"\r\n\r\nVisit the [Pico Wiki](https://github.com/mons-pico/wiki/wiki) for more details.\r\n\r\nThis work is being done at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://csiir.ornl.gov/), and all work is Copyright (c) 2012 by UT-Battelle, LLC.

{"tagline":"Web site for the Pico project.","body":"### Welcome to the Pico Site\r\n\r\nPico is a project to build an infrastructure for working with malware.  Right now the emphasis is on developing support for the Pico encoding, which provides a simple, lightweight encoding for malware files that (1) protects them from harm by anti-malware tools, (2) inactivates them, and (3) allows fast direct access to the raw bytes of the malware.  In short, the desire is to have something better than \"zip.\"\r\n\r\nInitial work is focused on getting the Pico encoding available in a few languages.\r\n* C++ / C (see pico)\r\n* Python (see pypico)\r\n* Java (see jpico)\r\n\r\nThis work is being done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and all work is Copyright (c) 2012 by UT-Battelle, LLC.
